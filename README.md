To configure Universal Server, modify the settings in the `config.ini` file located in the project's root directory. The configuration file includes options for the server port number, database connection details, and other customizable parameters.

## Creating the Database

Universal Server requires a `database.xml` file to store and manage client and file information. Follow the steps below to create the `database.xml` file:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the Universal Server project.

2. Locate the `database.xml.template` file and make a copy of it.

3. Rename the copied file to `database.xml`.

4. Open the `database.xml` file using a text editor.

5. Customize the database structure and add any additional fields or elements as per your requirements.

6. Save the file.

The `database.xml` file will now serve as the database for the Universal Server, storing client information and file ownership details. Ensure that the server has read and write permissions to this file.

Note: If you already have an existing database file or want to use a different database format, make sure to update the `CheckDatabaseConnection()` function in the `Program.vb` file to handle the connection accordingly.
